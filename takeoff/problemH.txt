You will have to know that,after the previous takeoff contest, Shakil got the job in NASA. He is given his first project by NASA.
The project is about the Voyager 1 (Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977) and the Hubble Space Telescope (Hubble is one of the largest space telescope)

Voyager 1 sends data to hubble telescope about the "Solar System", but hubble doesn't get all data that is given by Voyager 1.the voyeger 1 gives data as a packet. Each packet contains any kind of characters except("\n" and it means,packet has ended) .

Shakil found that,  if the total number of positive numerical values is a composite number(composite is which has factors other than 1 and itself) hubble will convert is to next prime number N and say "i got it".Othewise hubble will say "Bad luck".
Now it is your time to help shakil,so that he can say hubble got the data packet or not.

input:
input starts with an integer T (<= 50), denoting the number of data packets.Each data packet will contains characters (maximum size of 10^5).

Output:
For each test case print the answer like example.

Example:
input:
2
Na12SA
S898983

output:
Case 1 :Bad luck
Case 2 :7 i got it
