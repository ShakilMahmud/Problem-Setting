'Mahmud' is a delirious programmer.He likes binary numbers so much even he writes epistle to his beloved 'Jannat'.'Mahmud' uses binary numbers every where, therefore he made a machine,which will do his every binary calculations.Today is takeoff contest so the mad programmer 'Mahmud' decided to make a problem with binary numbers.

Input :
Input will start with a test case T(<=10),for each test case you have to input an integer number N (N > -1) that can be represented on 32 bits and will obviously be a decimal value.
Output:
Your work is to count the numbers of bits set to 1 in N's binary representation.

Examples:
input
2
23
5
output
4
2


***note: Mahmud will use his machine to Justify your output, so use faster process to calculate the value.
