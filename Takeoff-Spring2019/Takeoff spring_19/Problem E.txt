You will have to know that,Shakil was working for NASA till 2.5 years.In everytime if he faces any problem,he begs help to the talented Programmers of DIU.

NASA launched the Parker Solar Probe on August 12,2018 by the Delta IV-Heavy with Upper Stage at a speed of 154 km/s.On August 13,2018 the Solar Probe started to run by its own speeds.at the first day Parker ran at the speed of 2 km/h,next day parker ran at the speed of 3 km/h,at 3rd day Parker ran at the speed of 5 km/h and so on.....
shakil finds a pattern of speed increasing day by day as follows and the numbers are (A whole number greater than 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers.)

 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19.................................

Now, its your time to help shakil ,so that he can say the speed of Parker Solar Probe in given day's number.

Input:
input starts with an integer T (<= 10), denoting the number of test cases.Each test case will contains the day's number N (0 < N >= 10^3). 
Output:
For each test case print the answer like example.

Note: the day's number N will be counted from august 12,2018.

Example:
input:
2
1
9
output:
Case 1 :
154 km/s
Case 2 :
19 km/h
