So Mim need your help to solve this,
The problem for Couples who always love even and they always remaining even! And always match every side of them similar to palindromes!

So you are given three numbers T,  S(0=<S=<999), M(0=<M=<10^3) where  T denotes Test Case and S and M define the minimum and maximum range, you need to find the sum of first two Couples if you don't find any couples then the output will be "0".

	Example:
		input: s = 2 and m = 50
		output: 33
		where 11 and 22 are the first two couples in this range and they contain an even number of digits.
		and 11+22 = 33


input: 
2
3 50
110 213
output:
33
0
